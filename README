Ixonos MISP CIMD simulator is a Computer Interface to Message Distribution
(CIMD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIMD) protocol version 2.0 compliant server
that is designed to be used for developing and testing CIMD applications.
It can be used out-of-the box for development, functional and load testing CIMD send-only
and receiving applications. The simulator does not interface with a SMSC or MMSC.
It has been designed to be simple, light-weight, scalable and can easily be
extended for other use cases and purposes.
